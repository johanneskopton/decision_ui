# R-Code

The R-code page shows the R-code that was generated to run a Monte Carlo simulation using the
[decisionSupport](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/decisionSupport/index.html) package.

The R-code is only shown if the model was evaluated by clicking on the blue rocket button in the bottom-right corner.

## How the R-code is Generated

The R-code is generated by transforming each node from the model editor into a corresponding R-code statement.
Each node is represented by a variable in the R-code.
For example, a Math node labelled as `Total Income` that is connected to two input nodes labelled `Apple Income` and
`Sheep Income` is converted to the R-code statement:

```
Total_Income <- Apple_Income + Sheep_Income
```

A node label is converted into a variable name by removing all of its special letters except `A-Z` and numbers `0-9`.
Spaces are converted to the underscore character (`_`).

Only connected nodes are translated into R-code statements. Estimate nodes and Type Constraint nodes are skipped.

All generated statements are wrapped in an R-function called `model_function`. This function is then provided to the
[decisionSupport](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/decisionSupport/index.html) package to be used for the Monte
Carlo simulation.
